    <h3>IQ Test (from free-iqtest.org). My result (out of 100) was...</h3>
    <p>115. So I guess I'm around average.</p>
    <h4 id="question">So what do these results mean to you?</h4>
    <p>These results don’t really mean a lot to me as in that it is not going to change how I view myself as a person. They give me a good point of reflection as to who I am and understanding different points about myself which I never thought about before.</p>
    <h5 id="question">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h5>
    <p>These results wouldn’t change how I work as part of a team but would give me an idea as to why I do things in a certain way or why I feel certain emotions at times.</p>
    <h6 id="question">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h6>
    <p>Keep this information at the back of my head as to how I might affect the team as a person with this personality, traits, and thinking strategy. I should also share this information with members of my team as to get to understand who I am.</p>
