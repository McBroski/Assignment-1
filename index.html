    <!--This paragraph is about my personal information :)-->
    <h1 id="part-1">Part 1: My personal information</h1>
    <p>As you might already know, my name is Ceraph Toh. I live in Perth, WA. I am currently undergoing this Introduction to IT course as well as the Introduction to Programming course at RMIT.</p>
    <p>I really like programming and am enjoying learning Python as well as casual programming on Scratch (with Scratch blocks) and Khan Academy (with JavaScript and HTML - hence why I am writing this in HTML).</p>
    <h2>Some facts about me:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I usually like to compose songs on the piano or on a music software called FL Studio in my free time.
      <li>I also solve Rubiks cubes and similar puzzles (2x2, 4x4, Pyraminx, Skewb, and Square-1).
      <li>My fastest time for solving a Rubiks cube is 7.22 seconds and I can solve it anytime within 20 seconds.
    </ul>
    <!--Next is my short description about how IT is relevant to me-->
    <h1 id="part-2">Part 2: My Interest in IT</h1>
    <h3 id="question">Why IT?</h3>
    <p>I have an interest in computer related information and how things work in a digital world. My interest in IT started in primary school when I learnt how to code simple things on Code.org (if I remember correctly, it was something to do with moving a Minecraft character around). Ever since then, I was interested in how computers understood certain commands and so further stepped into the computing world. I chose RMIT because they ran some very interesting courses on computer programming and Information Technology. I hoped that by completing these courses, I would gain some knowledge as to where I would like to go in the world of computers and digital information. I didn’t really expect anything much as to what I would learn but it always is something that’s new for me.</p>
    <!--If I get into IT, I would start with this job first as a starting point-->
    <h1 id="part-3">My Ideal Job<h1>
    <h3>My Ideal Job would be:</h3>
    <a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Total-IT-Global&t=Casual&jk=c36bf04402fe3c63&q=it+support&vjs=3">https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Total-IT-Global&t=Casual&jk=c36bf04402fe3c63&q=it+support&vjs=3</a>
    <p>I chose this job Casual Desktop Support because it seems like a decent job to start off with in the world of IT. To apply for this job, you would need to have 1 year of Desktop support as a qualification. I currently don’t have the skills needed for this job as for now. I can undergo training courses to learn about different aspects of Desktop support and acquire the skills I need to be able to do this job.</p>
    <!--The next paragraph is summarising info about my personal information but doesn't have the screenshots-->
    <h1 id="part-4">My Personal Profile</h1>
    <h3>My Personality (from 16personalities.com) is...</h3>
    <p>ISTP-T (Introvert (I), Observant(S), Thinking (T), and Prospecting (P). Also Turbulent(-T))</p>
    <h3>My learning syle (from personalitymax.com) is...</h3>
    <p>Through Hearing, Seeing, and Doing.</p>
    <p>The last test of my choice was a...</p>
    <h3>IQ Test (from free-iqtest.org). My result (out of 100) was...</h3>
    <p>115. So I guess I'm around average.</p>
    <h3 id="question">So what do these results mean to you?</h3>
    <p>These results don’t really mean a lot to me as in that it is not going to change how I view myself as a person. They give me a good point of reflection as to who I am and understanding different points about myself which I never thought about before.</p>
    <h3 id="question">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
    <p>These results wouldn’t change how I work as part of a team but would give me an idea as to why I do things in a certain way or why I feel certain emotions at times.</p>
    <h3 id="question">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p>Keep this information at the back of my head as to how I might affect the team as a person with this personality, traits, and thinking strategy. I should also share this information with members of my team as to get to understand who I am.</p>
    <!--The next and last part of this page is my Project Idea, which is just the basic idea but might be hard to achieve-->
    <h1 id="part-5">Project Idea</h1>
    <h2>Develop a game!</h2>
    <h3 id="new_point">Overview:</h3>
    <p>What I think is a great project idea (and I always have wanted to try this) is to develop a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2, or Cocos2d. It won’t be an overly complex concept of a game, maybe just a simple style shooter, First Person or 2D, would be a starting point for developing a game. The main concepts of the game and how the game looks and runs isn’t really my concern now but to get to the stage where it is a possibility is the real goal of this idea.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Motivation:</h3>
    <p>To develop a working game concept is a huge goal of this project. If the basic game can work, that would motivate me to continue to follow this through with a full working concept and graphics of the game. What really motivates me to want to do this idea is to transform an idea to the simplest form of it working.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Description:</h3>
    <p>For this project, I would like to develop a working shooter game. This is just the idea of what I would like to achieve but there may be a lot of obstacles as to completing the game as to the standard of my idea.
      <ul id="selected-few">
        <li>Firstly, I would like to make the game a 2D shooter, with a variety of weapons, perks, and items that players can use or obtain.</li>
        <li>Secondly, the game would have different game modes to choose from: a story mode/campaign mode, which should be the bulk of the game, and a multiplayer mode, which would make the game fun because you are able to connect with other players over the game. Whether these concepts can work or not is up to how well the game development goes.</li>
        <li>Thirdly, there should be goals for the player to want to aim for. To make cool in-game items hard to get makes players want to get that gear no matter what the cost, to become the very best player of the game with the best gear.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>After developing the bulk of what the game is and how it runs, it would be good to implement in-game purchases. This is a large reason why all good game companies make good games, to make profit. This could easily be done by making the best gear seem too hard to get through hard work in the game, almost forcing the players to purchase the item with real monies.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Tools and Technologies:</h3>
    <p>To start with, I would have to research some on the best tools, or most relevant tools, for developing this game. By checking out which is suitable of Unity, Construct2, Cocos2d, possibly more, it could help narrow down the likelihood of the game being produced as a working copy with the right tool for the job. The game also may require testing across different platforms if it does get made for, example, Xbox.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Skills Required:</h3>
    <p>Good ideas (for the game concepts), a decent amount of programming (to program the game), and probably a large amount of understanding of different tools to make the game possible. It may take a long time to develop the tools and traits necessary to complete the game. It would also need a lot of perseverance and patience, which are key ingredients to make anything you might have not ever done before or with little experience.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Outcome:</h3>
    <p>If everything goes according to plan, a new game will have been completed and made for others to enjoy. All the hard work and motivation to pull of such a project will have paid off. If the game becomes a very big hit to the gaming sector, there would be a large amount of new opportunities for job positions, getting chosen to work at a reputed gaming company, and hard-earned money for the effort and work put into this project.</p>
