    <h1>My Ideal Job would be:</h1>
    <p>https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Total-IT-Global&t=Casual&jk=c36bf04402fe3c63&q=it+support&vjs=3.</p>
    <p>I chose this job Casual Desktop Support because it seems like a decent job to start off with in the world of IT. To apply for this job, you would need to have 1 year of Desktop support as a qualification. I currently donâ€™t have the skills needed for this job as for now. I can undergo training courses to learn about different aspects of Desktop support and acquire the skills I need to be able to do this job.</p>
