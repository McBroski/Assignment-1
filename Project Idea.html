    <h1>Project Idea: Developing a game</h1>
    <h2 id="new_point">Overview:</h2>
    <p>What I think is a great project idea (and I always have wanted to try this) is to develop a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2, or Cocos2d. It won’t be an overly complex concept of a game, maybe just a simple style shooter, First Person or 2D, would be a starting point for developing a game. The main concepts of the game and how the game looks and runs isn’t really my concern now but to get to the stage where it is a possibility is the real goal of this idea.</p>
    <h3 id="new_point">Motivation:</h3>
    <p>To develop a working game concept is a huge goal of this project. If the basic game can work, that would motivate me to continue to follow this through with a full working concept and graphics of the game. What really motivates me to want to do this idea is to transform an idea to the simplest form of it working.</p>
    <h4 id="new_point">Description:</h4>
    <p>For this project, I would like to develop a working shooter game. This is just the idea of what I would like to achieve but there may be a lot of obstacles as to completing the game as to the standard of my idea. Firstly, I would like to make the game a 2D shooter, with a variety of weapons, perks, and items that players can use or obtain. Secondly, the game would have different game modes to choose from: a story mode/campaign mode, which should be the bulk of the game, and a multiplayer mode, which would make the game fun because you are able to connect with other players over the game. Whether these concepts can work or not is up to how well the game development goes. Thirdly, there should be goals for the player to want to aim for. To make cool in-game items hard to get makes players want to get that gear no matter what the cost, to become the very best player of the game with the best gear. After developing the bulk of what the game is and how it runs, it would be good to implement in-game purchases. This is a large reason why all good game companies make good games, to make profit. This could easily be done by making the best gear seem too hard to get through hard work in the game, almost forcing the players to purchase the item with real monies.</p>
    <h5 id="new_point">Tools and Technologies:</h5>
    <p>To start with, I would have to research some on the best tools, or most relevant tools, for developing this game. By checking out which is suitable of Unity, Construct2, Cocos2d, possibly more, it could help narrow down the likelihood of the game being produced as a working copy with the right tool for the job. The game also may require testing across different platforms if it does get made for, example, Xbox.</p>
    <h6 id="new_point">Skills Required:</h6>
    <p>Good ideas (for the game concepts), a decent amount of programming (to program the game), and probably a large amount of understanding of different tools to make the game possible. It may take a long time to develop the tools and traits necessary to complete the game. It would also need a lot of perseverance and patience, which are key ingredients to make anything you might have not ever done before or with little experience.</p>
    <h7 id="new_point">Outcome:</h7>
    <p>If everything goes according to plan, a new game will have been completed and made for others to enjoy. All the hard work and motivation to pull of such a project will have paid off. If the game becomes a very big hit to the gaming sector, there would be a large amount of new opportunities for job positions, getting chosen to work at a reputed gaming company, and hard-earned money for the effort and work put into this project.</p>
